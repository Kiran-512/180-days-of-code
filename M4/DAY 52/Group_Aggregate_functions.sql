#Group/Aggregate functions
/*
#Single-Row Functions:-
- will operate on 1 row at a time
- Character, Number, Date, List, Environment Functions e.g. upper (ename), round (sal), etc.

#Multi-Row Functions: -
- will operate on multiple rows at a time
- Group Functions
- e.g. sum (sal), etc.
-- ============================================================
VERY IMPORTANT :
- null values are not counted in the group functions while calculating the results

3 restriction on group functions:
- We can not select column(field) with the group function
- We can not select the single row function along with the group function
- We can not use the group function in where clause as where clause is used for searching
	and searching takes place in server HD and that time avg(sal) function is not available as
    avg(sal) is done in the server ram afterwards when the search result is brought into the server RAM.

-- ============================================================
#group_by clause 
- Column used in 'group by' clause may or may not be present in the select statement
- where clause has to be specified before the group by clause.

#where clause before group by
- WHERE clause is used to retrieve the rows from DB server HD to server RAM
- WHERE clause has to be specified before GROUP BY clause
- where clause restrict the no of rows

#More than one columns in group by clause
- no upper limit on the the columns in the group by clause
- make sure to have the column name specified in select, in the group by clasue
- order of the column doesnt matters in group by clause but the representation would be different

- group by parent,child; --> will work faster
- group by child, parent; --- will work slower

#2D query:
any select statement with the group by clause is known as 2D query, 
because we can plot the graph from the o/p(x-y graph,pie charts, bar graphs etc.)

#1 Oracle graphics
- best s/w for making graphical representations

#spatial queries
- if we add one column in group by clasue it becomes 2 dimentional query
- if we add two column in group by clasue it becomes 3 dimentional query
.
.
.
- if we add n column in group by clasue it becomes n+1 dimentional query	

multidimetional queries also know as spatial queries

-- ============================================================
#HAVING CLAUSE
- its recommended that only group functions should be used in HAVING clause
- Becasue having works after group function excution in server RAM AND if we use having with the single coclumn name which we have used in select statement then it makes the query inefficient as we could have son e the same tak by using the where clause!  
- WHERE clause is used for searching
- Searching takes place in DB server HD
- WHERE clause is used to restrict the rows WHERE clause is used to retrieve the rows from DB server HD to server RAM
- HAVING clause works AFTER the summation takes place
- whichever column is present in SELECT clause, it can be used in HAVING clause but check point no 2
