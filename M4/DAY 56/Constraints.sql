/*
- Limitations/Restrictions on table

#Primary KEY(Columns):
- Columns or KEY that uniquely identifies a row (eg. EMPNO, PANNO,UIDNO etc. unique columns)
- Duplicate values are not allowed  
- It could not be in the sequence, and it could have msiing numbers, it could have alpha numberic values too! 
- Null values are also not allowed
- has to be unique, It's a mandatory column as user has to enter some value for this KEY
- Its recomended that every table should have PRIMARY KEY

- PURPOSE :
- We can distinguish between two rows of the table as Primary key would be unique
- Text and Blob can not be Primary KEY becasue of its size
- unique index is automatically created as we decalre any column as Primary KEY!

- If we declare a composite PRIMARY KEY then MySQL automatically creates a composite unique index 
- We can have ONLY ONE primary key PER TABLE.

Composite PRIMARY KEY :
- Combine two or more columns together to server the purpose of primary key
- in this the combination of tow rows wont repeat hence no duplicates key
- In MyQL we can combine upto 32 composite primary KEY
- In Oracle its 16 column

SURROGATE KEY:
- if we can not identify the primary key for our table then create new column and make it as primary key
- such primary key is known as surrogate key
- is not a constraint
- is a definition
- char is fixed lenght datatype and for surropgate key its programmer who can decide which datatype he can use
- char data type is recommended for suggate key

Why not int?
- int has size limit of which is smaller than the limimt of char.alter
- searching will be faster in int too!
 
Why dont we make ROWID as primary KEY?
- We cann't see ROWID in MySQL
- its fake column, pseudo column
- Its encrypted, something which I can not understand
- Row ID is not constant, if we update the row rowid may change!
- When rows are duplicate then in that case rowid will be duplicate too!
 
=> CANDIDATE KEY:
-> besides primary key, any other key which can server purpose of primary key is candidate key
-> its not a constraint
-> its a difinition
-> Its good practice to have couple of candidate key in the table, in future if we drop the primary key, then we can immidietly make the candidate key as primary key

===============================================================================

#DATA INTEGRITY =>

- All constraint are at the server level
- we can insert using the MySQL command line, workbench, MySQL PL, JAVA,.net,etc. the constraint will always be valid
- we can perform any DML operation using any front end s/w(java) , the constriants can be valid
- this is called DATA INTEGRITY

===============================================================================

internally constraint is MySQL created function, if performs a validations

to find out which constrains we have crated

#to check for all indexed columns from all the databases that you havea ccess to!
select * from information_schema.table.constraints; 

#to get all the indexed columns from particular databse
select * from information_schema.table.constraints
where table_schema= "database_name";
 
#to get all the indexed columns from particular table
select * from information_schema.key_column_usage
where table_name= " table_name";

================================================================
 
 show indexes from table_name;
 
================================================================
DROP primary KEY:

alter table table_name drop primary key;
================================================================
 
ADD PRIMARY KEY CONSTRAINTS TO THE EXISTING  TABLE AFTER WARDS
 
alter table table_name add primary key (column_name); 
 
================================================================
Assignments:
 
to chaneg primary key constraints:
1.drop primary key constraints
2.add primary key constraints
